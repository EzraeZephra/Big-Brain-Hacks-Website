      <p>
        The Big Brain Hacks team is a group of like-minded students who pursue
        excellence in the field of Computer Science. In order to do this, we
        participate in coding tournaments known as "Hackathons" to gauge and
        improve our skill level and win prizes against other student teams. By
        joining our team, we aim to improve members' critical thinking, problem
        solving, and teamwork skills through combined efforts during and before
        tournaments. However, before joining the club, applicants are expected
        to display a general knowledge of computer programming. Entry will be
        determined by the current team members.
